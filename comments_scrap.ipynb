      "Comment: Such a great show. Just so unfortunate that for the past 5-6 years Australia has been given a giant stiff arm and can‚Äôt access FULL EPISODES. All we get is heavily edited episodes that bleeps all the swears and profanity and cuts scenes completely out which is just unwatchable. I have been missing out on so many laughs and it leaves a bitter sweet taste in my mouth seeing so many family guy updates over the years and not being able to enjoy the show.

      "Comment: I have no joke being watching family guy nightly for well over 10 years I‚Äôve seen every episode over 100 times at least. It‚Äôs my comfort show, I‚Äôve watched it for years with my brother before he passed and I still hear his laugh when I watch it. I‚Äôve watched with every important person in my life. Who knew a tv show could be such a big part of my life and be so impactful. I‚Äôm sure I will outlive Seth but I hope this show goes on as long as possible, I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll rewatch episodes until the day I die. Thank you for so much laughter and joy over the years‚ù§Ô∏è\n",
