What’s happened to Seth green 😂😂
"My dad passed away in 2020 and up until his last days, Family Guy was his favorite show. Every week when we hung out he’d hit me with his favorite one liners. I hear the jokes he’d recite watching reruns now, so it’s almost like his humor is living on. Thanks for making us laugh ♥️"
"Never thought I’d be watching this show since the age of 3, one of my earliest memories I have growing up. My parents could never get me to stop watching it, eventually they gave up. Till this day it’s one of my favorite shows to watch, it’s a comfort show almost ❤️"
I love family guy 😂😂😂😂 I hope they never stop 😂😂
Better than The Simpsons by far 💯
I was so scared that it was gonna end but I'm glad Seth changed his mind!! Family guy is like a second family to me. Thank you family guy!! From a french fan 💕
This article looks freakin' sweet....
I've enjoyed every generation of Family Guy. Comedy still holds up today. You need a sense of humor to enjoy it.
"25 years of laughter, joy and roasts. Family Guy has been my comfort show for the longest time. Here's to 25 more years.🍻🍻🍻"
Dam Seth Green got old
Does Seth Green still have children in his basement?

Never stop
"Walt Disney loves this show so much, he bought the rights to it."
The best show ever!! Always makes me laugh! 😂🩵🩷❤️
Such a great show. Just so unfortunate that for the past 5-6 years Australia has been given a giant stiff arm and can’t access FULL EPISODES. All we get is heavily edited episodes that bleeps all the swears and profanity and cuts scenes completely out which is just unwatchable. I have been missing out on so many laughs and it leaves a bitter sweet taste in my mouth seeing so many family guy updates over the years and not being able to enjoy the show. Since covid 19 December 2019 Family Guy has just simply died in Australia
Fan since '99! ❤️
Greatest show I ever watched ever since I was 11
I got so scared for a second I thought it was ending I was about to say 😂😂
Family guy has been one of my favorite shows since I was a kid. I'm glad it's still around!
🐐🐐🐐🐐
Make it forever
Seth green starting to look like dr evil
i love this sm
"I remember my mother questioning Family Guy while growing up, and no matter how many times I would explain it to her and how funny the show is, she just never understood how hilarious it was to me! I’m a huge Family Guy fan! Been watching since I was a pre-teen and never got bored of it! Keep going! Don’t stop! Please keep the show going for as long as you guys can!"
Twins but starring Seth Green and Carrot Top
"Avid fan of 25 years. Crazy to think I’ve been watching this show almost half my life. Got my husband into it and now my daughter loves it. She knows the episodes better than I do. Sometimes when we have dinner, my daughter will throw on an old episode of family guy. It never gets old."
@joshy.star 👏
Myyyyyyy do I love this show. Brings us all endless joy. Cheers to another 25 @macfarlaneseth
I don't care what people say. American Dad and Family Guy must go on for as long as they can
"I thought it said ""irrelevent"" I'm not gonna lie 🤣"
🔥love you guys
Seth in the Zoom CMFT Zen Green Jordan 1s 🔥🔥🔥🔥

I hope it never stops! Still love it.
"If Simpsons goes on and this gets cancelled, that just means people have lost their sense of humor. I hope family guy keeps going, its a great show that has been comforting to watch"

Thank you Family Guy
Favorite show of all time
This show is home to me! Never stop!
One of my all time favorite shows ever!!!
The best show ever with the best cast!! 🥹🥹🫶🏻❤️❤️
Glad Meg finally shut up
"👏👏👏👏 We love family guy, feels like@home sometimes 🙌🙌🙌"
Twenty. Five . Years ????????????? 👏👏👏👏👏👏
I appreciate everything and everyone who makes this iconic show ✨️ 🔥❤️🙌
"I mean back then @familyguyfox would destroy the entire world with their jokes, but now starting at season 17 (I watched the show 3 times bingwstched it all) they just throw a little dirt and then that’s it 🥺"
The chicken fights are bad ass!
👏👏👏👏
The fact that half the family is Seth 😂❤️
An iconic revolutionary animated program.
Seth Family Guy
yeah bc if you stop- pass me the glock cause i'm OUT.
My family
I love this show❤️ please never stop 🔥
It looks kinda strange when you realize the 6 family members are played by 4 actors 😂
Seth Green look like a red head Magneto
I love family guy! Keep going!!! ❤️❤️🙌🙌😍😍
👏👏👏👏
It’s all hew and republican bashing
❤️❤️❤️❤️🙌🙌🙌
Love this!!!
Hasn't Mila Kunis only been there 24yrs as she didn't come in until season 2?
Holy crap I didn’t recognise Green!
I think moving it to Wednesday unforgivable!
The reason the characters dont age is because the cast doesn't either. But then I again I guess that wouldn't make much sense in Chris's case.
make a movie written by Seth
"I’ve been a huge Family Guy fan for a while now, I quote lines and reference scenes regularly in conversation but the newer episodes are just so on the nose it’s not fun or funny. Like the last couple of years it’s just been pretty bad I’m ngl like some jokes land but the majority are just good, it hurts me to say this. Still love you guys tho, also, the Ted tv series was fucking awesome, like the early seasons of the Goldbergs (before it went to hell) and Family Guy and Ted all in one. I love it"
The one person I would’ve loved to see this part of the cast would’ve been the late Adam West because the show did revised his career
My whole ❤️
Keep it going !!
One job id write a cover letter for
Looking forward to the 100 year anniversary! @familyguyfox
Seth Green went from 20s to 50 in a day
Don’t stop! Maybe I’ll see my kid doing voiceover in your show 🤷🏻‍♂️
❤️❤️❤️
Love this show!! Congratulations!! Keep it going!!
ITS MY FAVORITE SHOW EVER they are right I love it it makes me happy and they shouldn't stop!
too bad seth green likes kids
😂😂
This was my ENTIRE childhood 🙌
"Wait a minute, why they are 4 cast not 6 as... OHHHHHHH, yeah I forgot about the goat."
Thank GOD for Adult Swim for reviving and saving this brilliant show.
This is gold
Housekeeping???!
Please never stoppppp😭😭😭
"Not only is Family Guy the only truly funny show that exists today, but also has the best animation team. Truly brilliant."
Thank ya guys for making such a great show. The long ride along is so fun 🫡
Family guy is the greatest show ever. I rewatch it every month
"This piece reeks of cancellation, the lady doth protest too much to make people believe the show would go on when it aired a mere 15-ep season - kinda all-time shortest season - with no apparent cause! 😮😢"
"I have no joke being watching family guy nightly for well over 10 years I’ve seen every episode over 100 times at least. It’s my comfort show, I’ve watched it for years with my brother before he passed and I still hear his laugh when I watch it. I’ve watched with every important person in my life. Who knew a tv show could be such a big part of my life and be so impactful. I’m sure I will outlive Seth but I hope this show goes on as long as possible, I’m sure I’ll rewatch episodes until the day I die. Thank you for so much laughter and joy over the years❤️"
"My husband and I have been watching a show for as long as I can remember, before we go to sleep we like to have our laughs thank you Family Guy!😁🙏🏼❤️"
25 years of laughter!! it is my favorite show up until today since the age of 7.. a comfort show indeedd
Entonces... Seth green?
"Fun fact, Seth Green is older than Seth McFarlane by 8 months"
If family guy ends the world ends 💥
It seems today that all you see...
My FAVORITE show! Please never stop!! ❤️
Not me looking for Stewie and Brian 😂😂
Sorry but which one is Seth Green…🧐?
My guilty pleasure.

"Crazy I’m the same age as family guy, I remember watching it at the age on 8 thinking it was a harmless cartoon 😂 I love family guy"
My family quotes lines from Family Guy episodes to each and we laugh again & again. I think because we see parts of ourselves in them Thanks for the laughs❤️
